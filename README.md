# metapy - A metaheuristics library for python

`python 3.6`

Goal of this project to provide an easy to use interface to metaheuristics.
Metaheuristics are very powerful for quite a lot of optimization problems. Instead of reimplementing the whole algorithm for each problem, we want to provide a generic metaheuristics toolbox, where the user e.g. implements a fitness-function, chooses a crossover method and provides an initial population and is ready to start a genetic algorithm.
